# TfsAdvanced
This is a sister application for TFS.  It is to be deployed along side an existing TFS instance.

## Features
Central Pull Requests
TFS has weak support when it comes to managing code across multiple repositories.  The Pull Request section will agregate all the pull requests from all repositories and team projects.

## Build Definitions - Bulk Job Launching
Because of the unability to do chain buildings we needed a way to launch multiple builds at once.  this will show you all build definitions and their status

## Job Tasks
Having multiple Agents and seeing how many jobs are queued up is a pain.  This section addresses that and lets you see all builds and releases in a centralized spot.



Team Foundation Services ( & VisualStudio.com) does a good job but has some major holes and this project is created to address some of them.
